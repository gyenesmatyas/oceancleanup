                Our mission is to develop advanced technologies to get rid of the plastic in the oceans. We want to reduce the concentration of floating plastic with 90% by 2040. After years of research and testing, we've made our beta version of System 001. System 001 is a floating device with a net attached beneath it. This net reaches for around 3 meters under the surface. System 001 will move around the ocean in a c-shaped formation while collecting the plastic. While designing this system we've taken great care not to harm any of the wild life. The system doesn't use any engine, instead it moves around using the wind, the waves and the currents of the ocean. This makes it a passive cleaning system. System 001 is our beta version. It works great, but we want to learn from it and collect a lot of valuable information to make an even greater second version. When the plastic is collected and brought back to land, we work together with our recycling partners to process the plastic into desirable products that are durable and designed to not end up back in the oceans.

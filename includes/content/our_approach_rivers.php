                While cleaning the ocean, we should not only clean what is already out there, but also stop the incoming plastic from entering the ocean. Our research shows that 80% of the pollution originates out of 1000 rivers. We aim to tackle plastic in these 1000 rivers by 2025. The Interceptor is the first scalable solution to prevent plastic from entering the oceans. It's been designed for mass production and can be placed in alsmost every river. The Interceptor is placed in a river and the barrier is rolled out. The barrier will concentrate the waste to the mouth of the system. The Interceptor can store 50mÂ³ of waste before needing to be emptied. When it's full, it sends a text message to the operators to come and collect the waste. The Interceptor extracts up to 50 tons of plastic a day and can operate 24/7. We currently have two Interceptors up and running, one in Jakarata Indonesia and one in the Klang in Kuala Lumpur. We're currently working with governments all over the world to deploy in more rivers.
